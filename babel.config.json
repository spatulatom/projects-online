  /*
   * BABEL CONFIGURATION EXPLAINED:
   *
   * This configuration is specifically tailored for Jest test compatibility.
   * It converts ES Modules (ESM) to CommonJS format ONLY during test execution.
   * Your source files remain as ES Modules for normal development/build processes.
   *
   * ALTERNATIVE APPROACH:
   * It would be technically possible to keep tests running in ES Modules mode by:
   * 1. Using a simpler config like: { "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"] }
   * 2. Setting "modules": "auto" or removing the modules option entirely
   * 3. Ensuring all imports use proper file extensions (.js)
   *
   * The CommonJS approach used here offers better Jest compatibility, especially
   * for more complex test scenarios involving mocking and dynamic imports.
